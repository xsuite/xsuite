# The very non-obvious way files can be included in either sdist or bdist with
# setuptools. We need to list the file in:
# - MANIFEST.in if we want it in both sdist and bdist,
# - package_data and exclude it from the manifest if we want it in bdist only,
# - exclude_package_data if we want it in sdist only,
# - nowhere if we don't want to package them.
# Thanks to this setup an sdist can be build without the binary files, and a
# bdist can be build including them following the standard PEP 517 procedure
# using the `build` command.
